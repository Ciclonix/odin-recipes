        <img src="../images/burger_dogs.jpg" height="300px"> 
        <p>These baked burger dogs, hot dog-shaped burgers that are baked 
            in the oven, are great for when the cookout gets rained out, 
            or when you want to impress your guests, or just confuse your kids. 
            <br>The taste and texture may remind you of White Castle burgers.</p>   
             
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/3 cup finely diced red onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup diced dill or sweet pickles, well drained</li>
            <li>6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided</li>
            <li>8 hot dog buns</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). 
                <br>Grease a large 15x10-inch casserole dish 
                with 1 tablespoon melted butter or oil.</li><br>
            <li>Add beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, 
                red onion, pickles, and 4 ounces shredded cheese 
                to a bowl, and use a fork to mix until all 
                ingredients are evenly combined.</li><br>
            <li>Divide beef mixture into 8 equal portions. 
                Using damp fingers, shape 1 portion into a log 
                and gently press onto the bottom of a hot dog bun. 
                <br>Lightly press bun together, trapping the meat, 
                and place stuffed bun in the baking dish with meat 
                facing straight up. <br>Repeat until all 8 buns are stuffed.</li><br>
            <li>Brush all exposed areas of buns with remaining 
                1 tablespoon melted butter or oil, and sprinkle 
                over remaining 2 ounces of cheese.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meat is no 
                longer pink at the center, and buns are golden 
                brown and crispy on the edges, about 25 minutes. 
                <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted near the 
                center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Serve immediately with classic burger 
                and hot dog toppings and condiments.</li><br>
