        <h1>Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Casserole</h1>  
        <img src="../images/casserole.jpg" height="300px"> 
        <p>This chicken enchilada casserole recipe is so good that my 
            four picky kids eat it — and I got my picture in the paper for it! 
            <br>If you want to skip the charring step, simply tear the tortillas 
            into quarters so they absorb the sauce better.</p>   
             
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
            <li>18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can green chile enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                <br> Lightly grease a medium baking dish.</li><br>
            <li>Season chicken with garlic salt; arrange in the prepared baking dish. 
                <br>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices r
                un clear, about 45 minutes. <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted 
                into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Cool, shred, and set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, char each tortilla half over the open
                flame of a gas stove burner using metal tongs
                until lightly puffed, about 1 minute.</li><br>
            <li>Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce into the 
                bottom of a medium baking dish; arrange 6 tortillas 
                in a single layer on top.</li><br>
            <li>Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the cheese,
                 1/2 of the sour cream, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce.</li><br>
            <li>Repeat layers. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly 
                with some of the remaining enchilada sauce and arrange on top. 
                <br>Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with any 
                remaining enchilada sauce.</li><br>
            <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. 
                <br> Cool slightly before serving.</li><br>
        </ol>
