        <h1>Broccoli Alfredo Pasta</h1>  
        <img src="../images/broccoli.jpg" height="300px"> 
        <p>This broccoli Alfredo pasta is so pretty made with farfalle,
             also called bow-tie pasta. Of course, you may use fettuccine 
             if you prefer. <br> As a main dish, this serves 2; as a side, 
             it serves 4. Add a salad, if you wish, and some bread. 
             We love it as a side with grilled chicken or shrimp.</p>
